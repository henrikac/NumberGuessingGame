# Number Guessing Game

My first project in the **Python Web Development Techdegree** by [Teamtreehouse](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/)

## Requirements:

+ Python 3.6+

## How to use:

+ Navigate to the src directory: ```cd src```
+ Run the script: ```python guessing_game.py```

You can increase the difficulty of the game by setting the ```MAX_GUESS``` to a higher value by adding an argument to the program: ```python guessing_game.py 100```
